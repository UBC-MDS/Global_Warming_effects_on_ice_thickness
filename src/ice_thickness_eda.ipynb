    "\n",
    "The [data set](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/ice-forecasts-observations/latest-conditions/archive-overview/thickness-data.html) is from the Canadian Ice Thickness Program. The data has been collected weekly since 1947. The program was updated in 2002, so we are only looking at data prior to the update. Ice thickness is measured to the nearest centimetre using one of two methods; special auger kit or hot wire ice thickness gauge. "

Excluding the year 2002, there looks to be a downward trend from the earlier years where the median thickness is around 90 centimeters to the later years where it hovers around 60-70 centimeters. Our analysis aims to validate this trend and determine if the downward trend is statistically significant."

The shape of the distributions by month vary from month to month. We also see that that the months with the highest mean ice thickness are also those with the fewest observations and likely would not be great months to include in our analysis as they lack observations for a large sample. Months 1 (January), 2 February) and 3 (March) have a sufficient amount of observations for our study."

The three charts shows these distributions for each of January, February and March separately. We do this because we are curious as to whether the difference in median thickness of ice is subject to a certain month or whether this difference is present through all months. We can see that 1984 distribution has more mass to the right of the 1996, meaning more observations that record thicker ice. The pattern is present for all three months, however, January shows the sharpest example of this whereas the effect is less prominent in March. "
