## Project proposal

We are trying to answer the question, did the median ice thickness in the Canadian Arctic change by a statistically significant amount from the years 1984 to 1996? 
This question stems from the rising global temperatures and a curiosity of how this warming impacts the depth of the ice. 
The dataset used in this analysis contains measurements of ice thickness at various  established monitoring stations in the Canadian Arctic on a weekly basis. The data is made available from the Government of Canada and the monitoring is done by the Canadian Ice Thickness Program. Information about the program can be accessed through the Government of Canada and the specific dataset we are using is publicly available [here](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/migration/main/data/ice/products/ice-thickness-program-collection/ice-thickness-program-collection-1947-2002/original_program_data_20030304.xls).

Ice thickness is measured to the nearest centinmetre using one of two methods: an auger kit or a hot wire ice thickness gauge. The program started collecting data in 1947; however, this data is sparse so it serves our analysis to only use measurements from 1984 onwards. Each row of the dataset contains information including Station ID, Date, and Ice Thickness among other variables. Data was collected weekly at various stations.

To answer the questions mentioned above, we will select a data sample from a specific range of time for each year, ensuring to use the same range for both 1984 and 1996. We want to avoid the situation where we take data from a warmer timeframe in one year and colder temperatures in another as this will not be a fair comparison. We will then use this sample to conduct a hypothesis test using the permutation method to determine whether the medians of the ice thickness in 1984 and 1996 are the same or different. Preliminary data analysis shows the data to be right skewed and thus we've chosen to use the median instead of mean as our parameter of interest. To share the results, we will create a visualization that compares the two distributions of data, paying particular attention to the medians. Furthermore, we will report the difference between the median values along with the specific estimates in a table. 

To explore our dataset and help identify specific details that will be used in the analysis, such as the date rate for each year, we will perform exploratory data analysis. Visualizations that show how many records we have for each station and which months or years are most populated with data will be helpful for determining whether the available dataset will allow us to answer our inferential question and help us decide on how to generate our samples. We will also need to analyze the measurements to identify possible outliers and determine whether these are errors with the reporting or if they should be kept in our sample. Furthermore, we will showcase general trends in ice thickness over time which will lead to more rigorous statistical analysis.


## Usage

To replicate this analysis:
1. Run the entry script `import_.py`:
```shell
python src/import_data.py --url="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/migration/main/data/ice/products/ice-thickness-program-collection/ice-thickness-program-collection-1947-2002/original_program_data_20030304.xls" --out_path="data/raw"
```

2. Process the file with `pre_process.py`:
```shell
python src/pre_process.py --in_file="data/raw/ice_thickness.csv" --out_file="data/processed/ice_thickness.csv"
```

3. Generate EDA figures using `eda_figure_export.py`: 
```shell
python src/eda_figure_export.py "data/processed/ice_thickness.csv" "results/"
```

4. Perform analysis and export figures using `ice_thickness_analysis.R`: 
```shell
Rscript src/ice_thickness_analysis.R  --dir_in="data/processed/ice_thickness.csv"  --dir_out="results/"
```
